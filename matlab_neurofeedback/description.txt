The script Neurofeedback_beta.m accompanies the neurofeedback TDT circuit, for online calculation 
of the percentiles and presentation of data.
The RZ2 is controlled directly from the script, and requires the SDK functions from TDT to be added to the path.
These functions can be found here: https://www.tdt.com/support/matlab-sdk/
For further assistance with controlling TDT with matlab, please contact TDT support.
