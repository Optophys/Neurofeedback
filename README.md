# Neurofeedback
Code for "Real-time detection of neural oscillation bursts allows behaviourally relevant neurofeedback"
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/671602v1

Electrophysiology data can be found under https://gin.g-node.org/optophysiology/Neurofeedback

The script matlab_neurofeedback/Neurofeedback_beta.m accompanies the neurofeedback TDT circuit, for online calculation
of the percentiles and presentation of data.
The RZ2 is controlled directly from the script, and requires the SDK functions from TDT to be added to the path.
The SDK-files are kept for archivation purposes, please refer to https://www.tdt.com/support/matlab-sdk/ for the most up-to-date SDK version. For further assistance with controlling TDT with matlab, please contact TDT support.
